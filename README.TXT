##Overview: 
Jumper is a game in which the player seeks to solve a puzzle by guessing the letters of a secret word one at a time.
The rules are as follows:
    The puzzle is a secret word randomly chosen from a list.
    The player guesses a letter in the puzzle.
    If the guess is correct, the letter is revealed.
    If the guess is incorrect, a line is cut on the player's parachute.
    If the puzzle is solved the game is over.

##Running the Game:
To start the game, begin by running the "__main__.py" file.
